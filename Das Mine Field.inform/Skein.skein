Congratulations. you are now the district safety martial for Shady Oaks retirement district. This is where people put there old people when they don&apos;t want them anymore. Seeing as you are the only competent individual on the block, you got stuck with the job. However, not everyone is happy with this situation. Schnitzel, your crazy neighbor from across the stream, is furious. He really wanted that job apparently. In retaliation, he has used his retirement fund to build several automated potato launchers in a field next to his house. You are currently cowering under your porch. Your house and all of the houses surrounding Mr. Schnitzel&apos;s, are all being bombarded by flying potatoes. In the midst of the spudtacular air raid find a way out of here and get rid of those potato launchers. Move forward and stop Schnitzel&apos;s mad plan for neighborhood domination.

Das Mine Field
An Interactive Fiction by Ty Shimabukuro
Release 1 / Serial number 141024 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Your porch
This is your dinky wooden porch. Due to the veranda, it was the only part of your house that was safe from the raining potatoes. You ran here as soon as the spuds went flying. A vase full of umbrellas sits by the door. Your yard is to the west.
